1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves talking to users to understand their goals and challenges. Creating user stories helps translate these needs into clear tasks for developers, ensuring the development process stays focused on user expectations. User stories provide a structured way to prioritize features and tasks based on user value. This approach helps keep the project aligned with user needs and enhances the overall user experience.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I develop programs iteratively, focusing on user needs and using Agile methods like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. In the future, I plan to use practices like continuous integration, test-driven development, and regular user feedback to improve software quality. These Agile practices ensure that development is flexible and responsive to changes. They also promote collaboration and regular assessment, leading to more efficient and effective project results.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means actively contributing to team goals, communicating clearly, and supporting colleagues. It involves reliability, openness to feedback, and a commitment to continuous improvement, creating a positive environment. Good team members also share knowledge and skills to help the team grow. They contribute to creating more trust and respect, which is essential for successful teamwork.
